<h1>Course Readings</h1>
<p>The idea behind this page (and in making an interactive class web site) is to be able to
allow students to choose a specialty and have this site tailor the readings and assignments
list to include the core, required items plus those that the student needs to complete in
order to finish their specialty.   </p>
<p> The reading list is now displayed, sorted by day.  The Edit link needs to be hidden
unless the instructor is signed in (with admin credentials) or this page needs to be
copied and linked only from the instructor tools page and accessible only by the 
instructor.</p>
