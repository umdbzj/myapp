# README

This web application is a demonstration for Grinnell College's Software Design and Development course (CSC 324).
As an example - that will become useful in future semesters - this dynamic page will be the website for 
another course that I teach: CSC 105 The Digital Age.  

## Branches and Homework Assignments
Various branches correspond roughly to homework assignments, although I did, at times, forget
to create a new branch and coded significant features and changes on the master branch.  *Mea culpa.*



## Details and Versions
